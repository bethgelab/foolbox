        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : `numpy.ndarray`
            Batch of inputs with shape as expected by the underlying model.
        labels : `numpy.ndarray`
            Class labels of the inputs as a vector of integers in [0, number of classes).
        unpack : bool
            If true, returns the adversarial inputs as an array, otherwise returns Adversarial objects.
        binary_search_steps : int
            The number of steps for the binary search used to
            find the optimal tradeoff-constant between distance and confidence.
        max_iterations : int
            The maximum number of iterations. Larger values are more
            accurate; setting it too small will require a large learning rate
            and will produce poor results.
        confidence : int or float
            Confidence of adversarial examples: a higher value produces
            adversarials that are further away, but more strongly classified
            as adversarial.
        learning_rate : float
            The learning rate for the attack algorithm. Smaller values
            produce better results but take longer to converge.
        initial_const : float
            The initial tradeoff-constant to use to tune the relative
            importance of distance and confidence. If `binary_search_steps`
            is large, the initial constant is not important.
        abort_early : bool
            If True, Adam will be aborted if the loss hasn't decreased
            for some time (a tenth of max_iterations).
