        Can either try to find an adversarial perturbation for a fixed epsilon
        distance or perform a binary search over epsilon values in order to find
        a minimal perturbation.
        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : `numpy.ndarray`
            Batch of inputs with shape as expected by the underlying model.
        labels : `numpy.ndarray`
            Class labels of the inputs as a vector of integers in [0, number of classes).
        unpack : bool
            If true, returns the adversarial inputs as an array, otherwise returns Adversarial objects.
        generations : int
            Number of generations, i.e. iterations, in the genetic algorithm.
        alpha : float
            Mutation-range.
        p : float
            Mutation probability.
        N : int
            Population size of the genetic algorithm.
        tau: float
            Temperature for the softmax sampling used to determine the parents
            of the new crossover.
        search_shape : tuple (default: None)
            Set this to a smaller image shape than the true shape to search in
            a smaller input space. The input will be scaled using a linear
            interpolation to match the required input shape of the model.
        binary_search : bool or int
            Whether to perform a binary search over epsilon and using their
            values to start the search. If False, hyperparameters are not
            optimized. Can also be an integer, specifying the number of binary
            search steps (default 20).
        epsilon : float
            Limit on the perturbation size; if binary_search is True,
            this value is only for initialization and automatically
            adapted.
