        Parameters
        ----------
        input_or_adv : `numpy.ndarray` or :class:`Adversarial`
            The original, unperturbed input as a `numpy.ndarray` or
            an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
        label : int
            The reference label of the original input. Must be passed
            if `a` is a `numpy.ndarray`, must not be passed if `a` is
            an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
        unpack : bool
            If true, returns the adversarial input, otherwise returns
            the Adversarial object.
        binary_search_steps : int
            The number of steps for the binary search used to
            find the optimal tradeoff-constant between distance and confidence.
        max_iterations : int
            The maximum number of iterations. Larger values are more
            accurate; setting it too small will require a large learning rate
            and will produce poor results.
        confidence : int or float
            Confidence of adversarial examples: a higher value produces
            adversarials that are further away, but more strongly classified
            as adversarial.
        initial_learning_rate : float
            The initial learning rate for the attack algorithm. Smaller values
            produce better results but take longer to converge. During the
            attack a square-root decay in the learning rate is performed.
        initial_const : float
            The initial tradeoff-constant to use to tune the relative
            importance of distance and confidence. If `binary_search_steps`
            is large, the initial constant is not important.
        regularization : float
            The L1 regularization parameter (also called beta). A value of `0`
            corresponds to the :class:`attacks.CarliniWagnerL2Attack` attack.
        abort_early : bool
            If True, Adam will be aborted if the loss hasn't decreased
            for some time (a tenth of max_iterations).
