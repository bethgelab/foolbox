class Attack(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for adversarial attacks.

    The :class:`Attack` class represents an adversarial attack that searches
    for adversarial examples. It should be subclassed when implementing new
    attacks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a :class:`Model` instance
        The model that should be fooled by the adversarial.
        Ignored if the attack is called with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
    criterion : a :class:`Criterion` instance
        The criterion that determines which inputs are adversarial.
        Ignored if the attack is called with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
    distance : a :class:`Distance` class
        The measure used to quantify similarity between inputs.
        Ignored if the attack is called with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
    threshold : float or :class:`Distance`
        If not None, the attack will stop as soon as the adversarial
        perturbation has a size smaller than this threshold. Can be
        an instance of the :class:`Distance` class passed to the distance
        argument, or a float assumed to have the same unit as the
        the given distance. If None, the attack will simply minimize
        the distance as good as possible. Note that the threshold only
        influences early stopping of the attack; the returned adversarial
        does not necessarily have smaller perturbation size than this
        threshold; the `reached_threshold()` method can be used to check
        if the threshold has been reached.
        Ignored if the attack is called with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.

    Notes
    -----
    If a subclass overwrites the constructor, it should call the super
    constructor with *args and **kwargs.
