    The :class:`Attack` class represents an adversarial attack that searches
    for adversarial examples. It should be subclassed when implementing new
    attacks. Subclasses must implement the _apply method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : :class:`adversarial.Model`
        The default model to which the attack is applied if it is not called
        with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.
    criterion : :class:`adversarial.Criterion`
        The default criterion that defines what is adversarial if the attack
        is not called with an :class:`Adversarial` instance.

    Notes
    -----
    If a subclass overwrites the constructor, it should call the super
    constructor with *args and **kwargs.
